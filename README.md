### Neighborhood map project

This is a project in which knockout.js library is used to simplify creating and updating the contents on the page. The page has a sidebar on the left and a google map with several markers on the right. The form on the left is used to control markers on the google map. An external API (Foursquare) is used in order to get additional info that is shown when user clicks on a marker.

The project was done as part of [Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.
